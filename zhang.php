	<h1>Dr. Yongli Zhang</h1>
	Professor Zhang received his Ph.D in molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale University in 2003. With Prof. Donald Crothers, he studied sequence-dependent DNA bending and flexibility. He then moved to the West Coast and joined Prof. Carlos Bustamante's group in UC Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow, where he applied single-molecule manipulation approaches to investigate the molecular mechanism of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF and RSC. In January 2007, Prof. Zhang returned to the East Coast and started his research group in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In July 2009, Prof. Zhang moved back to Yale with his group members and took his current position.
